.SH NAME
polaric-importcert-letsencrypt \- Import certificate for use in HTTPS backend
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B polaric-importcert-letsencrypt
.RI " domain-name"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
polaric-passwd has a web-server backend. This can be run in HTTPS mode, but then it need 
a certificate. This script converts and imports an existing certificate into the Java keystore
so that it can be used by aprsd. If the server runs on the same domain (for example mydomain.org) and machine as a frontend server which already have a certificate. We can use it. If this certificate is automatically installed by using a service like Lets Encrypt and certbot, a certificate is placed at a certain location: You may check if the directory /etc/letsencrypt/live/ exists. Then (as root) run this command with domain-name of your frontend server and the certificate.
