.SH NAME
polaric-importcert-snakeoil \- Import certificate for use in HTTPS backend
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B polaric-importcert-snakeoil
.RI " domain-name"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
polaric-server has a web-server backend. This can be run in HTTPS mode, but then it need 
a certificate. This script converts and imports an existing certificate into the Java keystore
so that it can be used by aprsd. If the server runs on the same domain (for example mydomain.org) and machine as a frontend server which already have a certificate. We can use it. 

A self-signed certificate (Snakeoil) is generated by the package ssl-cert. This script installs this certificate in the keystore.
Note that this is not signed by a CA, it is self-signed. Browsers connecting the service will complain and you have to 
explicitly make an exception to accept this certificate. This is ok if you know that you are talking with your own
server.
